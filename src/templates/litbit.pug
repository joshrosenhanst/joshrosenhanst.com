      p The <a href="./litbit/">LitBit website</a> generates small poems using random lines of text from classic literature.

      p Using public domain books from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Gutenberg</a>, LitBit looks for similarly sized lines of text and randomly selects 3 lines to print out as a poem.

      p Although the text is entirely derivative, the poem is a new, unique creation and can have meaning entirely separate from the original source.

      p <strong>Technologies:</strong> Flask, Python, HTML5, CSS3

      h2: span.header-text Book Processing

      p Each book used on the website is processed using a Python script which reads the plain text file line by line and groups them by the number of syllables.

      p The number of syllables are estimated using the <a href="https://github.com/akkana/scripts/blob/master/countsyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countsyl.py</a> script which uses a few simple rules to determine the number of syllables. The syllable count isn't perfectly accurate, but works as a way of comparing similarly sized lines. The lines are also sanitized to remove extra whitespaces and quotation or other marks that don't have a matching symbol (for example, when a quotation starts on one line and ends on another).

      p The list of lines grouped by syllable count is saved in <code>.json</code> format and the <code>books.json</code> file is updated with each processed book's author, title, and image.

      h2: span.header-text Poem Creation

      p When the user visits LitBit, the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask framework</a> handles the HTTP request and generates a poem. LitBit looks up the selected book's <code>.json</code> file and prints 3 random lines, along with the book's title and cover image.

      p Using the <a href="https://hashids.org/python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashids</a> library, the indices of each line are encoded into a single URL, which can uniquely identify this generated poem so that the poem can be shared.
